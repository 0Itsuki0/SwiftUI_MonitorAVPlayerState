# SwiftUI_MonitorAVPlayerState

Demo on Monitoring AVPlayer State with Observable introduced in iOS 26, tvOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Two steps to observable AVPlayer State: 
1. Opt-in to monitor playback state with observation by setting the isObservationEnabled property of AVPlayer to true.
2. Use the AVPlayer or AVQueuePlayer like any custom Observable class we create by ourselves!
